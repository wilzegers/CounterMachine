# Counter Machine Simulation

The objective of this repository is twofold:
1. Implementing a [counter machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter_machine)-simulator.
2. Implementing an algorithm to reduce the number of different instructions used in a machine to 3 without modifying it's behaviour.
  The instruction set it's reduced to is of the [known equivalent instruction subsets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter_machine#Basic_features).
